<p>I received a great gift from work last week.  It came in the form of a rectangle, and fit in the palm of my hand.  It has made my life easier and more enjoyable.  In fact it has single handedly changed the way I approach most things throughout my day.</p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>A brand new SSD hard drive.</p>

<p>I've never witnessed the power of a SSD drive first hand.  I've used friend's computers that had a SSD drive, but never before has my own computer been running an SSD drive.</p>

<p>Let me tell you:  it's glorious.</p>

<p>I decided that during the installation of the SSD I would also install a fresh copy of OS X (as opposed to a Time Machine restore).</p>

<p>I figured it'd be fun to log the steps I took after installing Mountain Lion. They're fraught with monotony but one that every user must go through when setting up their machine after a fresh install.</p>

<p>So what follows is my Post Mountain Lion install log. I did exactly what I expected: install my favorite applications and set up my system presences. Only surprises were the settings I forgot I had ever changed in the first place.</p>

<p>Without further ado!  The list!</p>

<h1>Afterward</h1>

<p>There isn't much left say.  After the first three days of ferocious software installation and customization I was pretty much done and comfortable with my current computer setup.</p>

<p>There were a few things I did forget to copy from my old hard drive that proved to be a bit of a nuisance.  I forgot to backup my Transmit favorites and had to prowl through my old hard drive to find where those files were saved.  I also forgot to backup my Apple Developer keychains which I ended up just re-creating.  Next time I'll just back them up safe and sound.</p>

<p>The speed of the SSD drive made installing all my old programs so fast that the once laborious process of setting up my computer from scratch went by in a blink.  Tasks that used to require patience as my HDD read and wrote bytes were done before I was even ready for the next task.</p>

<p>There's no turning back for me now.  I have seen the glory of SSD.  My future has been written.</p>
