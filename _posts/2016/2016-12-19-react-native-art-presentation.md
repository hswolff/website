Earlier this year I had the great opportunity to be a speaker at the [Crater Remote Conference](https://conf.crater.io/). I presented about my experiences with using [React Native ART and D3](/blog/react-native-art-and-d3/), giving a complete walkthrough and explanation of my example application [BetterWeather](https://github.com/hswolff/BetterWeather).

The [recording of this talk was recently posted online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEHyyd9RU3s) and I wanted to share it with you all.

There's a slight technical snafu that happens in the first 5 minutes but after that it's smooth sailing.

Enjoy!
