Last month I had the pleasure to attend MongoDB World 2017. It was my first time attending a conference as an organizer rather than an attendee. It was a lot of fun seeing behind the scenes. Getting a feel for all the work that is required to run a successful conference was a great experience. I always knew it was hard work to run a conference, but to actually see it and live it was an amazing opportunity.

Continuing my recent trend of making vlogs, I filmed one of my time in Chicago and attending MongoDB World 2017. Please enjoy.
