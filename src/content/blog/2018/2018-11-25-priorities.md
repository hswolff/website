This past weekend was Thanksgiving which meant that I spent the past couple of days with family. It was great to unplug and get away from the ridiculously fast paced world of tech and coding. However by virtue of unplugging it meant I wasn’t able to make anything. Instead I was able to focus on health and family, letting everything else I usually worry about fall to the wayside.

I’m a firm believer in the following priorities:

- Health
- Family
- Everything else

# Health

Without your health you don’t have anything. If I’m feeling unhealthy then everything else that I’m preoccupied with immediately becomes de-prioritized.

Health covers anything and everything related to your well-being. From the physical to the mental and everything in between.

Health is what enables you to do everything else, and if you’re not taking care of yourself then you won’t be able to do anything else.

# Family

I say family generically, in the spirit of those you love and trust.

If you’re not maintaining and nurturing the relationships you have with your family then you’re going to be in for a lonely time, and life is hard enough when you try to go it alone.

Family is there to nurture you back to health when you’re feeling unwell, and family is there to celebrate with you in your times of joy.

Family is the backbone to all your endeavors, making tasks that may feel impossible, possible.

# Everything else

If you have your health, and you have family, then you can start tackling whatever else tickles your fancy. Usually that means work or a hobby, but truly it’s up to you. Whatever it is should be rewarding and enriching.

For me it’s work and all my side projects, such as this blog and making YouTube videos. They make me feel accomplished and productive, two feelings that I greatly enjoy.

# Remember your priorities

It’s always important to remember your priorities.

This weekend my priority was family. Then I made health my priority by not staying up too late to make a video and exhaust myself.

After all that was done I was able to tackle everything else. Such as this blog. Cuz it makes me feel good to make something.

What are your priorities?
