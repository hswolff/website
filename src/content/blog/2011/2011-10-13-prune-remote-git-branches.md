Git is a wonderful version control system. It’s light, nimble, and fast. It makes managing code amongst many developers a dream.

Unfortunately it has a fair share of quirks.

One of the quirkiest quirks that I’ve run into a couple times now is an issue with remote git branches.

When a remote git branch is deleted from the server your local repository doesn’t update its references.

The easy solution is to run this command:

<code>git remote prune origin</code>

This prunes and removes all remote branches that no longer exist.
