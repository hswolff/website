On September 27th, 2019 I gave a conference talk in Alicante, Spain at [React Alicante 2019](https://reactalicante.es/).

Believe it or not this was my first true conference talk of 2019! What fun!

Had a great crowd show up for my talk. It was in the middle of the morning on the first day which turned out to be a great time to get high attendance.

My talk was called _Evergreen Legacy Applications_, here was the summary:

> While most of the world is excited about all the newest and coolest technologies you’re stuck maintaining a legacy application. It’s not glamorous, but it works and pays the bills. What if you could have the best of both worlds? Keep your legacy application and use the latest and greatest tools? This dream can be your reality. I’m here to share some of the techniques, ideas, and code I’ve used to make this dream come true. While the task may seem daunting, if you come to this talk you’ll learn strategies you can use to slowly migrate your legacy application to become evergreen.

It was largely about my experience migrating the MongoDB Atlas application from Backbone.js to React over the past 3 years. A lot of fun!
