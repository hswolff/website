Recently I was a guest on [freeCodeCamp's Podcast](https://podcast.freecodecamp.org)!

I had a lot of fun chatting with [Abbey](https://twitter.com/abbeyrenn), the host, who asked wonderful questions that let me talk at length about my career.

[There's a wonderful blog post up about the contents of the episode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-startups-to-manager-at-mongodb-podcast/) if you want to read the cliff notes, but to get most of the meat definitely tune in and listen.

[Here's a direct link to the episode](https://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-78-from-early-stage-startups-to-manager-at-mongodb).
