So not only is the end of 2019 quickly approaching, but so is the end of a decade. The 2010s are drawing to a close. An entire decade is over, and we're just about to enter the 2020s. What an amazing time to be alive.

I wanted to take a few moments to reflect on the past year. Quite a lot happened and I would be remiss if I didn't reflect on the growth and exciting events that happened to me in 2019.

I've also made a video talking about my 2019 in case you want to see this post in video form:

## 2019 Most Watched Videos

Last year I was used to getting between 300-500 views per video. If a video cracked more than 500 views I was ecstatic. It meant people were actually watching what I was creating.

This year could not have been more different. This year I regularly had videos cross over 1000 views, a fact I am still not quite used to.

Getting so many people watching my videos is such a wonderful progression for my YouTube channel. It's so encouraging and helps me keep going.

I went through all the videos I made in 2019 and sorted them by most viewed. Here's that list:

## Other 2019 Milestones

Some really exciting things happened in 2019!

I [spoke at a conference, React Alicante 2019](https://hswolff.com/blog/react-alicante-2019/)! It was really fun getting to present to people in person. Getting to share my ideas in real time was a lot of fun. I love feeling the audience listen while I talk, and adjusting how I present to make it the most entertaining and informational.

I was also [a guest on FreeCodeCamp's Podcast](https://hswolff.com/blog/guest-on-freecodecamp-podcast/) where I got to talk about myself for an hour straight. It was fun sharing my history: how I got my start in the industry, what my progression looked like, how I got to be who I am today. If you're curious about that backstory then that is definitely the best place to start.

And also...if you're reading these words...I started blogging again! 2018 was a very light year for blog posts but I was able to actually get myself back into the writer's seat and put some "ink to papper" so to speak. I hope to keep that up going into 2020.

## The Future

I have quite a few projects I want to take on in 2019 (like I don't have enough, wth Harry).

The first one has already begun: [I started a newsletter!](https://tinyletter.com/hswolff/). This is the direct result of ending [the podcast I created](https://theconsolelog.com/) but it has nearly the same format and content. Want to stay up to date on the latest JavaScript news? Subscribe!

A big project I want to take on next year is create a full-fledged course. Probably it'll be to teach React but there's no certainty about the topic. However I do want to make a full length course that lets me dive deep into a subject and teach it as well as possible. Stay tuned as that project progresses!

I also want to do more for my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/hswolff) patrons, make that even more of a valuable membership. I recently started a Discord server for my Patrons, such that if you become a Patron you get to talk to me in real time! It's so real you can practically touch me!

Here's to next year and the next decade! Happy New Year!
