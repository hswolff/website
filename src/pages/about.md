Hello! This page is all about me. Written by me. Quite meta.

I currently live in New York City with my wife and son. We've been in NYC for over 6 years now and have enjoyed every minute. Sure, it's the city that never sleeps, but that works for us.

During the day I [work](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hswolff 'LinkedIn') at [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com/) where I'm a Lead Engineer, leading a team of engineers to make coffee into code. It's an overused expression, but some days it truly feels as simple as that.
