Every so often I get asked what I use for all my content creation.

Wonder no more!

Here is a list of all the fun things that I use on a daily basis.

# Editor + Terminal

- Visual Studio Code is my current Editor
  - I use a lot of VSCode plugins. [See the full list here.](https://gist.github.com/hswolff/3da81efbbfbfa9b284b441df458033a5)
- Theme is [Atom One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/andischerer/vscode-theme-atom-one-dark)
- Using default VSCode font, `Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace`
- iTerm is my terminal
- I use a pretty vanilla installation of [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for additional terminal functionality

# Recording

- I use the built in Mac Quicktime Player to record my screen
- I use a Sony a6400 to record myself
- I use a [Shure VP83 LensHopper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DU66WWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to capture the audio directly into the camera
- And because the Sony camera doesn 't support a monitor and an external mic I use a [Microphone Stand Extension Plate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P8JSV1G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I put it all on a [Joby GorillaPod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003II3FD0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I take the two recordings and edit them with [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

# Desk Setup

- My computer is a 15-inch MacBook Pro (Mid 2015, 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3)
- I do not use an external monitor.
- I have an external Apple Keyboard and external Apple Touchpad
