Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm so glad you've found your way to my little newsletter.

You're going to get 2 things from this newsletter:

1. A weekly update that contains all the latest and greatest JavaScript and frontend news. It's the best way to stay up to date and keep yourself ahead of the curve.

This includes new library releases, long tutorials, and general frontend discussions that help you become an overall stronger engineer.

2. Random and unplanned updates about the work that I do! This may include a new YouTube video, or a new course that I want to share with you.

And that's it!

I hope to have you join!
