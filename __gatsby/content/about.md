Hello! This page is all about me. Written by me. Quite meta.

I currently live in New York City with my wife and son. We've been in NYC for over 6 years now and have enjoyed every minute. Sure, it's the city that never sleeps, but that works for us.

During the day I [work](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hswolff 'LinkedIn') at [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com/) where I'm a Lead Engineer, leading a team of engineers to make coffee into code. It's an overused expression, but some days it truly feels as simple as that.

I'm pretty damn social, so you can find me on most social networks. Such as:

<div class="external-networks">
<style>
    .external-networks a {
        box-shadow: none;
    }
    .external-networks a + a {
        margin-left: 20px;
    }
</style>
